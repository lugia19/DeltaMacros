# DeltaMacros
Macro recording tool that uses delta mouse movements, designed for games where normal macrorecorders fail.

It also records/plays back keyboard inputs.


## Usage
You simply press F9 to start/stop the recording, which also saves it.
Finishing the recording also starts the latest saved script, which can be played back with F4. 

It'll be saved as currentscript_ some number, it avoids overwriting any existing ones.

Before you can record a new one you must quit out of the previous one with ALT-F12.
The scripts can also obviously be run by themselves, and the hotkeys are once again F4 and Alt-F12.

Thanks to @burque505 for the exit button code and @need4speed for making me notice I forgot to record mouse clicks.
